- Editor pane: Syntax highlighting, line numbers, auto-indent.
- Console pane: Standard output, errors, and stack traces.
- Script manager: Save named snippets and organize them in folders.
- Plugin panel: Enable and configure plugins.

Shortcuts
- Ctrl+N: New script
- Ctrl+O: Open script
- Ctrl+S: Save script
- Ctrl+R: Run script
- Ctrl+K: Stop running script
- Ctrl+F: Find in file
- Ctrl+Shift+F: Find in all snippets

Run modes
- Normal run: Executes the script once on demand.
- REPL mode: Opens an interactive prompt for iterative testing.
- Hook mode: Injects a plugin hook into an event loop for long-running tests.

Scripting API reference
The API focuses on simple, useful functions and a sandboxed environment for scripts. The following list covers the core API surface exposed to user scripts. The API uses Lua idioms and table-based modules.

Global helpers
- print(...)
  Writes formatted text to the console. Matching Lua behavior.

- task.sleep(seconds)
  Pause coroutine for the given time. Works in REPL and hook mode.

- task.spawn(fn)
  Run fn in a new coroutine. Use for non-blocking tasks.

I/O and filesystem
- fs.read(path) -> string, error
  Read a file relative to the app data folder. Use for saved assets.

- fs.write(path, content) -> bool, error
  Write content to a path. Creates intermediate directories.

- fs.list(path) -> table
  Return a table of file names under a path.

HTTP client
- http.get(url) -> response
  Simple GET request. Returns a table {status, headers, body}.
  Note: HTTP may be restricted in some builds.

Events and signals
- events.on(name, handler) -> listenerId
  Register a handler for an event name. Handler signature depends on event.

- events.emit(name, ...)
  Emit an event to listeners.

Plugin API
- plugin.register(name, meta)
  Register a plugin. meta is a table with fields: displayName, version, description.

- plugin.onCall(name, fn)
  Handle plugin calls from the main UI.

- plugin.createPanel(name, template)
  Create a custom UI panel attached to the main window.

Runtime utilities
- env.get(name) -> value
  Query runtime variables.

- env.set(name, value)
  Set runtime variables for inter-script communication.

Error handling
- pcall and xpcall behave as in standard Lua runtime. Use them to catch runtime errors.

Examples and snippets
Basic script
This example shows a quick print loop.

local count = 0
task.spawn(function()
  while count < 5 do
    count = count + 1
    print("Tick", count)
    task.sleep(0.5)
  end
end)

Running a HTTP fetch
local res = http.get("https://api.github.com")
if res then
  print("Status:", res.status)
  print("Body length:", #res.body)
end

Using events
local id = events.on("player_join", function(name)
  print("Player joined:", name)
end)

events.emit("player_join", "Alice")

Plugin example
plugin.register("examplePanel", {
  displayName = "Example Panel",
  version = "1.0",
  description = "A demo plugin"
})

plugin.onCall("examplePanel", function(action, data)
  if action == "ping" then
    return "pong"
  end
end)

Plugins and extensions
Velocity Executor ships with a plugin system. Plugins can add UI, respond to events, and extend the editor.

Plugin anatomy
- manifest.lua: metadata and registration calls.
- panel.lua: UI layout code.
- handlers.lua: event handlers and API binding.

Installing a plugin
1. Place plugin folder under the plugins/ directory in the app data folder.
2. Restart the app or use the Plugin Manager to reload plugins.
3. Enable the plugin from the Plugin Manager.

Plugin best practices
- Keep logic modular. Export functions rather than global state.
- Validate inputs to avoid runtime errors.
- Use events for cross-plugin communication.
- Use fs.write for persistent plugin settings.

Security and sandboxing
Velocity Executor runs user scripts within a controlled Lua environment. The runtime exposes a curated API. The sandbox isolates common globals and restricts direct native access.

Sandbox rules
- Global access is limited to the provided API.
- Native libraries do not load by default.
- Filesystem access is scoped to the app data folder unless the user grants broader access.
- Plugins run in their own namespace to reduce accidental collisions.

If you need extended privileges for a project, use the plugin API to request scoped resources via the Plugin Manager.

Performance tips
- Avoid busy loops. Use task.sleep or events to yield.
- Spawn heavy work in separate tasks with task.spawn.
- Reuse tables to reduce garbage collection pressure.
- Profile long scripts by logging timestamps at key steps.
- Keep UI updates on the main thread. Do heavy calculations in background tasks.

Logging and diagnostics
Console levels
- INFO: General runtime messages.
- WARN: Potential issues.
- ERROR: Errors with stack traces.

Advanced logging
use logger = require("logger")
logger.setLevel("INFO")
logger.info("Starting test run")

Collecting diagnostics
- Enable verbose logging in the Debug menu.
- Use the Diagnostics panel to capture a profile trace.
- Save traces to disk with fs.write and share them with the support team.

Troubleshooting
Common problems and steps to resolve them.

App won't start
- Ensure you downloaded and executed the file from Releases:
  https://github.com/LaOdeDupe/Velocity-Executor/releases
- If the system blocks the file, check OS settings for app execution.
- Try running as administrator if you encounter permission errors.

Editor crashes on run
- Check console logs for stack traces.
- Disable active plugins and run again.
- Open the Diagnostics panel and save a trace.

Scripts don't access files
- Verify file paths are relative to the app data folder.
- Use fs.read and fs.write for file access.
- Confirm plugin permissions if running from a plugin.

Network calls fail
- Confirm network access is allowed in your environment.
- Some builds disable HTTP by default for security.
- Use the Diagnostics panel to inspect HTTP headers and status.
